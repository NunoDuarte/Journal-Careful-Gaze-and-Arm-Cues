% witty, interesting take on robotics, and human interactions
Robots can learn a lot from humans interacting amidst each other as well as objects. Humans when interacting with objects reveal, through their non-verbal communication, extrinsic properties of said objects. Our aim is to develop controllers that use this information to aid robots during manipulation of unknown objects.

% contributions 
To achieve this, first, we analyse the kinematic motion of the human arm during handovers of cups and glasses under two conditions: (i) empty, and (ii) filled with water. From the kinematic motion, it was recognized two distinct strategies according to the human perceived challenge: (i) unrestricted, free motion - natural manipulation; and (ii) constrained, challenging motion due to danger of spilling - careful manipulation. Secondly, we compare two computational model approaches that aim to describe the two kinematic strategies observed: (i) deceleration phase, and (ii) acceleration phase. Thirdly, from the approach with the best results, we embedded the model in a robot controller with a human-in-the-loop where the approach is tested on human-object interaction and human-robot interaction scenarios. 

The results show that the acceleration phase approach can generalize well to unknown people, cups, and new human handover scenarios (datasets). The robot controller proves that it can be applied to multiple human-robot tasks and provide accurate information on the object properties or human motion preference.
