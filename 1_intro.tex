\section{Introduction}

what you talk about:

- in the intro you introduce the idea, the challenge, the different ways that people have tried to use to solve it, and your proposal
- you mention the CV people who are trying to detect liquid levels or if the cup has liquid or not from images or videos. There is a problem with occlusions, different types of cups, color of cups, opaque cups (where it is impossible to tell). I propose another way that helps solve that problem
